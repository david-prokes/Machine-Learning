# Machine-Learning

This repository contains a selection of Machine Learning projects developed during my Master's program. The projects are organized by language and explore various aspects of applied ML using real-world data.

## Structure

- `R/`: Projects developed in R using R Markdown.
- `Python/`: Projects developed in Python, using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Topics Covered

- **Supervised Learning**
  - Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, SVM (linear & RBF), AdaBoost
  - Regression: Linear models, Polynomial regression, Ridge, LASSO, Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Squares (PLS)
  - Discriminant Analysis: LDA, QDA

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - PCA for dimensionality reduction
  - K-Means clustering on multivariate indicators

- **Model Evaluation**
  - Cross-validation (k-fold, LOOCV)
  - Confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, MSE
  - Feature importance and model interpretability

- **Image Data Processing**
  - Classification of CIFAR-10 image subsets using raw pixel features

- **Environmental Data Modeling**
  - Definition of custom target variables from regulatory thresholds
  - Classification of air quality levels
